The Countdown Timer is a simple yet effective Python application that allows users to set a timer and get notified when the time is up. This application is perfect for tasks such as cooking, studying, exercising, or any other activity that requires time management. The project utilizes the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI), the time module for time manipulation, and the playsound module to play a sound when the timer reaches zero.
